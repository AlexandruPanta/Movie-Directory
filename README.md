# Movie Directory

This project is a movie directory application built with React[^1^]. It allows users to enter data about movies, display the movies data, and filter through existing movies[^1^].

## Components

The application has 3 main components[^1^]:

1. **Movieform**: This component allows the user to enter data about movies[^1^].
2. **Movieslist**: This component displays the movies data[^1^].
3. **Search**: This component allows the user to filter through existing movies[^1^].

Each movie object in the Movielist should have the following properties: name (the name of the movie), rating (the rating of the movie in the range of 0 to 100), and duration (the duration of the movie in hours)[^1^].

## Functionalities

The application has several functionalities:

- The Movieform component has fields for 'Movie Name', 'Ratings', and 'Duration'[^1^].
- The Movieslist component displays the movie data sorted by duration in descending order[^1^].
- The Search component allows the user to filter through existing movies in the directory by the beginning characters[^1^].
