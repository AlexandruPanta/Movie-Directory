# Movie Directory

This project is a movie directory application built with React. It allows users to enter data about movies, display the movies data, and filter through existing movies.

## Components

The application has 3 main components:

1. **Movieform**: This component allows the user to enter data about movies.
2. **Movieslist**: This component displays the movies data.
3. **Search**: This component allows the user to filter through existing movies.

Each movie object in the Movielist should have the following properties: name (the name of the movie), rating (the rating of the movie in the range of 0 to 100), and duration (the duration of the movie in hours).

## Functionalities

The application has several functionalities:

- The Movieform component has fields for 'Movie Name', 'Ratings', and 'Duration'.
- The Movieslist component displays the movie data sorted by duration in descending order.
- The Search component allows the user to filter through existing movies in the directory by the beginning characters.
